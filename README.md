# Ð¡rackmes challenge
Here I am going to publish simple (sometimes a bit more complex) crackmes. There is not much benefit from the traditional solution, so I decided to reconstruct the program logic and create analogues along with the solution itself. Maybe this will help someone greatly.

 Have fun ;)
